A collection of test programs and utilities for testing the various peripherals for BearlyML23 and Robochip. `peripheral_test.c` is a test program designed to exercise the I2C, GPIO, and PWM controllers, having the GPIO count up from 0-65535, I2C0 transmit 0-255, and PWM demonstrating normal, phase correct, and PWM channel ganging. The two `nearmem_dma` tests are for BearlyML23 specifically and will not function with Robo. These programs are designed to be built Baremetal IDE though the header files included in this repo have had most of stdlib removed in an effort to make the binaries small enough to upload to BearlyML23. The `nearmem_dma` tests can be run by simply uploading the ELF binary to the chip and waiting for a response from UART and `peripheral_test.c` can be verified using the latest FPGA image on bwrcrepo which contains a signaltap configuration for reading IOs.
